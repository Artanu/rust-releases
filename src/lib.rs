//! This crate aims to provide an index of Rust releases, and make it available to Rust programs.
//!
//! ## Introduction
//!
//! The Rust programming language uses deterministic versioning for toolchain releases. Stable versions use SemVer,
//! while nightly, beta and historical builds can be accessed by using dated builds (YY-MM-DD).
//!
//! Unfortunately, a complete index of releases is not available any more. There are however
//! a few places where we can find partial release indices, from which we can build our own
//! index.
//!
//! This process consists of two parts: 1) obtaining the data sources, and 2) building the index
//! from these data sources. For the first part this crate provides the [`FetchResources`] trait, and
//! for the second part the crate provides the [`Source`] trait.
//!
//! These traits are implemented for certain index strategies:
//! 1) [`DistIndex`]: Build an index from the AWS S3 Rust distribution index
//! 2) [`FromManifests`]: Build an index from Rust [release manifests](https://static.rust-lang.org/manifests.txt)
//! 3) [`ReleasesMd`]: Build an index from the [RELEASES.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/rust/master/RELEASES.md) found in the root of the Rust source code repository
//!
//! In the below example, we chose the third source type, and we'll use it to show you how you can
//! use this library.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rust_releases::{FetchResources, Source, Channel, ReleaseIndex};
//! use rust_releases::source::ReleasesMd;
//!
//! // We choose the ReleasesMd source for this example; alternatives are DistIndex and FromManifests
//! let source = ReleasesMd::fetch_channel(Channel::Stable).unwrap();
//!
//! // Build a release index using our source of choice
//! let index = ReleaseIndex::from_source(source).unwrap();
//!
//! // Do something with the release information
//! index.releases()
//!     .iter()
//!     .for_each(|release| {
//!         println!("release {:?}", release)
//!     });
//!
//! ```
